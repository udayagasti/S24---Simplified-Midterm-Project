**Project Title: Malware Detection System**

**Objective**: Develop and deploy a cloud-based PE static malware detection API.

**Introduction:**
The project aimed to address the growing threat of malware by creating a machine learning-based system capable of identifying malicious PE files. Leveraging cloud infrastructure, the goal was to provide a scalable solution accessible via a web interface.

**Training:**
Trained a machine learning model on a dataset of PE files to classify them as malicious or benign.
Utilized Python libraries and tools like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for model development.
Achieved high accuracy through rigorous training and validation processes.

**Deployment:**
Deployed the trained model on Amazon SageMaker, leveraging its scalability and ease of use.
Integrated the model into a cloud-based API, allowing real-time predictions over the internet.
Ensured reliability and security by following best practices for cloud deployment.

**Client Interface:**
Developed a web-based client interface for users to upload and check files for malicious content.
Implemented user-friendly features for seamless interaction and intuitive usage.
Ensured compatibility across different web browsers and devices.
